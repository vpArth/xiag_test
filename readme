Installation:
  - Database:
    1. create database
    2. import structure.sql
    3. update config.json
      - dsn, username, password
    4. also should be pdo extension installed

  - Cache:
      Memcache used, but it wrapped, and if Memcache not installed or server is not running all will work fine without cache.

  - Config:
      for local configuration use git ignored config.local.json file(just put it near config.json)

  - Run server:
    I use internal php server for development, each other server, like Apache or Nginx
        should serve static files(index.html, css/*.css, js/*.js, ) in document root,
        and if requested files don't exist rewrite queries to in.php script
    for run internal server, simple execute run.sh script, or manually execute something like "php -S localhost:8000 ./in.php"
